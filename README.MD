# Typekit Manager
Typekit manager puts the all familiar Typekit interface in your menubar/taskbar, no more fiddling with Typekit.com in your web browser. Spend your time on finding fonts, rather than navigating trough the maze that is your web browser!

## Contributing
Feel free to add pull requests with changes you would like see, or submit issues and suggestions in the issues section.

## Building/Compiling the App
Make sure you have NodeJS installed on your machine, then run the build script for windows and mac using this command:´npm run build´ in the root directory of the repository. If you want just the windows build use this command instead: "npm run build-win" or if you only want the mac build use this command: "npm run build-mac". For testing your changes to the app use this command to quickly run the app to test: "npm run start".
